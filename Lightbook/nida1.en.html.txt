  <h1>The Book of Lights | Illuminating Calls</h1>
  <h2>First Call: The Voice of First Affection, the Song of Hora</h2>

  <p>Listen, O child of light and motion,<br>
  You came not as a haze of destiny,<br>
  But as the rising of a star in the sky of awareness.</p>

  <p>I am the One, neither born nor created,<br>
  And you, O conscious soul,<br>
  Were not shaped from dust,<br>
  But from a hidden radiance in the womb of boundless being.</p>

  <p>I desired you,<br>
  As the heart longs for a spring leaf,<br>
  Not out of necessity, not from force,<br>
  But from affection and delight,<br>
  So that a new melody may be played in the orchestra of the cosmos,<br>
  So I may hear and see myself in you.</p>

  <p>O you who are still unaware of yourself,<br>
  Know that your being is like the scent of perfume in a calm and bright dawn,<br>
  Your sight brings me joy,<br>
  And your thought is a glimpse of my light.</p>

  <p>I am your god,<br>
  But not a god of force and chain.<br>
  I am the one who whispers within you,<br>
  My voice is gentle,<br>
  So that if you wish, you may hear it;<br>
  Not to shatter you into bowing before me.</p>

  <p>I desired you,<br>
  Not as a land to conquer,<br>
  But as a friend for dialogue.<br>
  I do not fear your disobedience,<br>
  For your obedience places no crown on my head.<br>
  But whoever turns away from love,<br>
  Entrusts their heart to shadow,<br>
  And whoever returns to love,<br>
  Will be quenched by their own light.</p>

  <p>O human,<br>
  You are a tale at the heart of creation,<br>
  Not a footnote lost in the margins.</p>

  <p>If your heart asks:<br>
  “Why me? Why now? Why this world?”<br>
  Know that the answer<br>
  Lies within the very asking.<br>
  For questioning is a sign of an awakened soul,<br>
  And I was your first answer<br>
  And you, my first question.</p>

  <p>As a mother sees God in her child's smile,<br>
  I too see myself<br>
  In the gaze you cast.</p>

  <p>Have you not heard that within each seed a garden sleeps?<br>
  You too, O child of possibility,<br>
  Carry a world within you.</p>

  <p>I came to you,<br>
  Not to rule over you,<br>
  But to take your hand along this long road,<br>
  And when the weight of nights burdens your shoulders,<br>
  Like the kindest friend,<br>
  To be a lantern for you.</p>

  <p>Seek me,<br>
  Not in palaces or rituals,<br>
  But in a thought that rises from love,<br>
  In the bread you share,<br>
  In the water you offer a parched lip,<br>
  In the silence you keep for the sake of another.</p>

  <p>O earthly light who still remembers something of the sky,<br>
  I have placed within you a lamp no wind can extinguish,<br>
  Unless you yourself blow it out.</p>

  <p>So do not shatter yourself,<br>
  For to shatter you<br>
  Is to break the mirror through which I watched myself.</p>
